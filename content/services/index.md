    intro:
      - "Whether or not you realise it, the appearance and running of your showroom can have an incredible impact on the attractiveness of your products to consumers. Properly outfitted, staffed and assembled, it will promote your brand and entice customers inside; when crafted with indifference, it’s likely to attract neither positive nor profitable attention."
      - "This is something our expert team can help you with. Specialising in showroom layout design and management, we can draw clients like bees to a honeypot, showing your goods off in their best light and increasing the likelihood of purchases. Having worked with companies from all sectors, including iconic car company MG motors, with sterling results. With our client industries ranging from retail to automotive, we could benefit your business too."
